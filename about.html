    <h2 id="about_heading">about me</h2>
    <p id="about_p">My name is Olga Baeva. I am a first-year student at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. I am originally from St. Petersburg and have lived in Denmark for a bit over four years. 
      <br>
    I am married, have no kids, and reside in Vanl√∏se.</p>
    <p>My previous education from Russia is also within IT, although I educated about 15 years ago and never got a chance to work within my specialty. Last four years in St. Petersburg I worked in a small company as a project supporter. </p>
    <p>Now, when I live in Copenhagen, I want to use the chance to get back on the IT track and become a web developer.</p>
    <p><b>My skills: </b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github, teamwork, attention to detail, verbal & written communication, responsibility, dependability.</p>
    <p>As a person, I am positive and organized. In my spare time, I like to read, watch series, walk, and grow indoor plants.</p>
    <p>I also have a cat whom I brought with me from St. Petersburg. It's a girl, her name is Maroussya. She is almost nine years old and has been with me her entire life exept the first two weeks of her life. She has adapted well here, in Denmark, and seems to be happy and healthy. It's her we filmed for the first assignment of the Basic Content Theme "A story without words".</p>
