        <h4>about basic UX theme</h4>
        <p>Through research, analysis, content production with a focus on copywriting, knowledge about UI conventions, prototyping, and testing, we learned about UX designer's role in the value chain of digital productions. We learned about paper prototypes made in Adobe XD and paper prototypes, we also learned how to conduct online surveys. We were introduced to user journey maps and copy and microcopy.</p>

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on research, analysis, and user research documentation.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a pdf document where all the research documentation is gathered.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this assignment, I learned that you always start your data collection from <b>desk research</b> to broaden your understanding of the topic. Also, while acquiring information directly from the context of the people you design for (<b>observation research</b>), you should document everything. Because, at this point, you don't know yet what might hold a potential interest in the product you are developing.
          <br>
          As part of the assignment, we had to conduct an interview. I chose <b>informal type of interview</b> because I did not know what exactly to focus on, and, also, I wanted my interviewee to feel like we were just having a trusting conversation.
          <br>
          My online survey research I conducted through <b>google forms</b>. It gave me some good insights for the future webshop project.

      <h3>early prototypes</h3>

          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on ideation, prototyping, content production, testing, and optimizing our solution ideas based on our research insights. 
          <br>
          I played the <b>facilitator's role</b> in this group assignment. Moreover, I was responsible for paper prototype, participated in ideation, designing, working on UI conventions, navigation, typography, and conducting five seconds and trunk tests.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a prototype designed in Adobe XD that shows purchase flow, uses UI conventions and has relevant content plus documentation reflecting ideation process, UX storyboard, paper prototype, and test results.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this assignment, as well as from the feedback, I learned that <b>ideation process</b> should start from <b>sketching</b> out all the tiny ideas on paper in order to afterward elaborate them in one final sketch, and how to make user experience efficient and comfortable with UI conventions and microcopy.
          <br>  
          In our T-shirt webshop "Vintagen" we used <b>UI conventions</b>: hamburger menu, clicking on the logo leads to the landing page, search field, footer, bread crumbs, and cart icon.
          <br>
          We also used <b>microcopy</b> as a method of user interaction improvement: footer where the user can find other media platforms accounts,  menu where the user can check the website structure/navigation, and buttons where the user can see and choose what to do next.

          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on finalized XD prototype as a proof-of-concept solution prototype and documented solution in a visually sharp and communicative format.
          <br>
          I played the <b>facilitator's role</b> in this group assignment. Moreover, I was responsible for documenting the identified problem and created a solution as part of the final documentation. Also, I participated in solution improvement based on the test results from the previous assignment and worked on the presentation.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a documented finalized proof-of-concept solution prototype made in Adobe XD.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe, the most important thing I learned from this assignment is to participate in <b>group work</b>, i.e. discuss, argue, rely on other group members, and come to one final decision.
          <br>
          Other than that, I learned how to present (pitch) the solution created.
