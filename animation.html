        <h4>about basic animation theme</h4>
        <p>
          This theme was the most challenging but also the most interesting theme of the first semester. Here we designed and developed a major multimedia project (game) from idea and sketching to final implementation. We used such methods and tools as idea-generation, activity and state machine diagrams, sketching techniques, mood board, and style tile. We developed CSS animations and JavaScript to make the game interactive. In this theme, we also learned how to work with diegetic and non-diegetic sounds, and we used version control system (git) for the first time.

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on thinking through the logic of the game, making sure that all the rules fit together, and that we are absolutely sure of what the mechanics are.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is the activity diagram that describes an activity as a collection of detailed actions and decisions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment helped me to structure my idea; the activity diagram was sort of a mock-up of the game's logic that I referred to while further implementing my game (codewise and for SMD).

          From this assignment, I learned that my game instructions were not entirely understandable. For example, a fellow student did not realize that firedrops were still dangerous after landing on the floor, so, I added this to my instructions. Also, based on peer review, I decided to add instructions to the right of the game screen. This way, a gamer doesn't have to click on anything in order to see the instructions.

      <h3>Asset list and design documentation</h3>

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on creating a design for the game, documenting the design's decisions, and making the asset list, so that it meets the requirements.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a pdf document with a link to the game's assets uploaded to the domain and design documentation.

          In this assignment, we were introduced to <b>basic shapes</b> as a method to design the game characters. Based on the method, I decided to compose the main character (kitten) mostly of round shapes which makes it lovable, and a player wants to rescue it from the fire. I made the fire in a form of a triangle with pointed ends which makes it dangerous, and a player feels the urge to rescue the kitten. The water drop is rounded as well as the kitty - itâ€™s a good element and will extinguish the fire when clicked. The bookshelves, painting, and table have squared shapes representing a solid unmovable background.
          <br>
          From the styles suggested, I liked most the <b>flat design</b>. So, I found a gif and illustrations on Pinterest of a cat running around a house. I used those as a basis for my illustrations. Since I chose to make my game in flat design, all my illustrations are composed of simple shapes (sometimes with help of the anchor point tool or pen tool), with no strokes.

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on designing and structuring the user interface, learning practice-oriented development methods for digital media production, introduction to technologies as part of designing and programming of UI.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a pdf document with a link to the final interactive animated game and design documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this assignment, we were introduced to <b>CSS animations</b>. In my game, sprites come falling down from the top, so the "Falling" animation placed on a sprite's container. When clicking on a sprite, the sprite disappears, and it's another animation placed on the sprite. I had to place these animations on two different HTML elements since two animations don't work on the same element. I also added a sprite animation on firedrops and the background fire so fire moves at all times of the game. I think it makes the situation more realistic.
          <br>
          Another technology we were introduced to is <b>JavaScript</b>. In my game, I use functions as independent blocks of code which will only be executed when some other piece of code calls it. For example, I made function startAnimations() which adds animation and position classes to sprite containers, as well as event listeners; and because it's an independent piece of code, it can be called and executed from any place in the program.
          <br>
          I also used <b>methods</b> in my game to add and remove classes (f.x. with animations) and <b>event listeners</b> (click, animationend, animationiteration) to elements.
          <br>
          To implement logic, I used conditional <b>if statements</b>. So, if the user clicks on a waterdrop, they get plus one point, but, if the user clicks on a firedrod, they lose a life.
