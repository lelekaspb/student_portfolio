        <h4>about basic web theme</h4>
        <p>The theme taught us to sketch wireframes, create responsive websites, work with mood boards and style tiles in order to design UI, use grid design and CSS grid for UI Development. 
        <br>
        We learned how to work with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe XD, also HTML, CSS, and to work in a code editor, to upload webpages on a domain using FTP-client, inspect and test code in developer tools, validate code using W3C Validator.</p>

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on semantic markup, styling, and text-editing of a one-page basic mobile website.
          <br>
          To achieve that, I had to chunk up the given text content, divide the text into separate blocks, and add subheadings to increase readability.
          <br>
          Later I added the text in an HTML document by applying appropriate HTML tags.
          <br>
          To style the webpage, I applied few Gestalt Laws, namely <b>Proximity</b> and <b>Similarity</b>, in order to make it easy for the user to understand which heading belongs to which block of text. I also used contrast to highlight the headings to let the user know where they should start reading. I chose to use a <b>sans-serif</b> font for the page as sans-serif is easier to read.
          <br>
          Besides Gestalt laws, contrasts, and typography, I learned how to resize and optimize images in Photoshop, make on-page navigation, upload files on a domain using Filezilla.
          <br>
          In this theme, we were introduced to image formats and image compression. All images used in this assignment are in jpg format because jpg makes a picture weight less, and the quality loss is not seen on a computer or phone screen, hence, the browser downloads the page faster.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a webpage designed for mobile view.

          <b>The product</b> - four-pages responsive website.
          <br>
          In this assignment, I, for the first time, used grid composition and wireframes to design, CSS grid and media queries to develop a digital product.

          It was an <b>individual assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on semantic markup, styling, and content production of a responsive website.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> - five-pages responsive website.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the most challenging assignment of the theme. Here we further explored composition and contrast, learned about art styles, used mood boards and style tiles as tools for designing the website.
          <br>
          I chose the <b>minimalism</b> style for my interest-based website, on the illustration you can see the style tile I created and later used as style guidelines for further development of the product.
          <br>
          Later, we made sketches of  the layout (wireframes) and prototypes in Adobe XD.
          <br>
          On the sketch, you can see my initial thoughts on layout patterns for different screen sizes.
          <br>
          For Desktop view I have three columns and two rows. One column is for the Header and the two others for the content (main section). One row for the Header and Main, and the other for Footer.
          <br>
          For Tablet view (850 px breakpoint), the <b>layout shifts</b> from two rows to three, i.e. I add one more row for Header, and the content takes up all three columns.
          <br>
          For the Mobile view (500 px breakpoint) I used a <b>mostly fluid multi-device layout</b> as only margins of the content change.
          <br>
          Also, for this assignment we created dynamic buttons and logo in Adobe Ai, and, afterward, conducted five seconds test and trunk test.
