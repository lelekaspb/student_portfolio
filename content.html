          In this theme, we were introduced to copyright, copyleft, and immaterial rights. We learned about different media platforms and video formats they use; about basic film language, i.e. when to use close-up shots and medium or long shots.; how to compose background for a shot, and how and when to use camera movement. We also learned how to create personas and use them for future user-centered development.
          <br>    
          Finally, we learned how to make Pecha Kucha presentations for the client.

          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on producing a one minute video without the use of any words and tells a story. <b>My role</b> in this assignment was to participate in idea-generation and shooting the video.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is one minute video without wsords that shows one day of a cat's life. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment taught me to use the 5 shots technique as a method to tell the story. To bring the story together, we used shots: close up hands to show the action, close up face to show the facial impression, wide shot to show the surroundings, over the shoulder to make the the scene more dynamic.
          <br>
          As part of this assignment, we had to demonstrate that we understand <b>intellectual property rights</b>. That is why we only used royalty-free music and our own produced video clips.

      <h3>Pre-production part 1: Treatment</h3>
      <img src="assets/jpg/treatment.jpg" alt="sketch of the narrative used for treatment">
      <div class="subtext">
        <p>
          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on documentation of preproduction (elaborated idea): title, theme, logline, treatment.
          <br>
          <b>My role</b> in this assignment was to participate in ideation, work on the documentation, and create a persona.
          <br>  
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a pdf document with a written title, theme, logline, and treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this assignment, I learned how to elaborate an idea while working in a group, discuss and come to one right decision within the team, and document the elaborated idea into a <b>treatment</b> keeping in mind the <b>personas</b> we created earlier. For example, one of our personas, Ida Nilsen - a 12-year-old girl from a small town in Denmark who is curious, but too shy to talk to her parents about sex. We used this persona as inspiration for the main character (a teenage girl) in our treatment.

      <div class="subtext">
        <p>
          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on documenting entire video shot by shot with all relevant information (shots, angles, location, time, framing, camera movement, sounds).
          <br>
          <b>My role</b> in this assignment was to participate in the discussion of scenes, shots, dramaturgical elements, creating a dramaturgical curve.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a pdf document with a storyboard and dramaturgical curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this assignment, I learned that it's important to make the storyboard as detailed as possible in order to minimize the time of shooting the video and avoid confusion while shooting the video. The storyboard helped us decide on <b>shots</b> (as to where we use the medium shot or close-up), <b>location</b> and <b>time</b>. And later, we did not have to spend so much time shooting the video, because we already had a pretty clear idea of what we need to do.

      <div class="subtext">
        <p>
          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a focus on pretotyping of a website based on the brief from the client (Cherry Pop).
          <br>
          <b>My role</b> in this assignment was to participate in sketching and discussing design.
          <br>
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a fully responsive pretotype of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this part of the theme, we were introduced to <b>pretotyping</b> as a method of identifying potential strengths and weaknesses of productions. As I understood, pretotype is used to check whether the idea has a future or it will fail before starting the implementation. This way you avoid unnecessary costs and time waste in case of failure. On our pretotype of the website, we made a “download button”, that would help Cherry pop to understand how many people would actually want to download the app.
          <br>
          We wanted the website to mainly draw attention to the app, that’s why it only has information about the app, the team behind cherry pop, and one of the commercial videos for parents we made.
          <br>
          Another thing that I learned from this part of the theme is how to <b>handle video with JavaScript</b>. We embedded a video on the website, made a play, pause, and stop buttons for users to control the video.

      <h3>Customer pitch</h3>

      <div class="subtext">
        <p>
          It was a <b>group assignment</b> with a <b>focus</b> on communicating the development process for digital content production to the collaborative partner with professional insights.
          <br>
          <b>My role</b> in this assignment was to work in a group on the customer pitch (Pecha Kucha presentation).
          <br>  
          <b>The product</b> of the assignment is a Pecha Kucha client pitch of our solution showing how we are helping Cherry Pop with our solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the assignment, we had to research and decide for media platforms we were going to publish our videos on. Our research showed that Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram are the most popular platforms in the Nordics, and, since Cherry Pop briefed us that they were targeting Denmark and Norway, we decided to go for those three <b>social media platforms</b>. We made our videos in Feed format (16:9 for Facebook and Youtube, and 1:1 for Instagram) because Feed videos are suggested to users based on their interests, timeline, and relationships. That means that people who have already been looking for similar content would see our videos as well.
